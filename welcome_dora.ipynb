        "Our orbital corridors are getting more crowded with increased space-based services while existing public services like the *Global Navigation Satellite Systems* [(GNSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) such as Russia's *Global'naya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema* [(GLONASS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS), China's [BeiDou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeiDou), the European Union's [Galileo](https://bit.ly/3R3zFRf) and the United States's *Global Positioning System* [(GPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) which we rely on from food delivery to online dating. There are plenty of resources that cover the academic, policy, news and legal aspects of the space junk problem and the crowding of our orbits - both different topics where junk refers to past space objects left by the results of the Cold War between the former Soviet Union and the United States while crowding referring to today with the rise of mega-constellations such as [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink), [Kuiper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Systems), [OneWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutelsat_OneWeb) [and](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Preparing_for_the_Future/Discovery_and_Preparation/Managing_mega-constellations) [more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_internet_constellation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the proliferation of satellites and existing debris in orbit, the chances of close approaches between space objects increases. Satellite operators (caretakers) often have to make quick decisions and maneuver to avoid collisions, using messages that tell them when objects might come too close. These messages are called Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs) and are sent in large batches weekly, but most of them don't require action. This creates a challenge for satellite operators. An process that can predict collision risk with desired accuracy while accounting for modelling bias a couple of days ahead to allow satellite operators to plan for collision avoidance maneuvers can be helpful.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of analysing whether a possible collision event is likely is called, Conjunction Analyses/Assessment. While this notebook is meant to give a brief overview and to get you started in the process of calculating collision risk quickly, if you'd like to dive deeper, a good starting point is *NASA's Spacecraft Conjunction Assessment and Collision Avoidance* [Best Practices Handbook](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/OCE_docs/OCE_50.pdf) which can further help you burrow into the rabbit hole of spacecraft conjunction assessment and collision risk.\n",
